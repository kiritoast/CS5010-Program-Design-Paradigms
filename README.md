**CS 5010 Course Overview:**

CS 5010 serves as the introductory course for students in Northeastern's MS program, aiming to achieve two primary objectives. Firstly, it equips students with foundational skills in program design, encompassing problem analysis, test suite development, and utilization of various program design paradigms. Secondly, the course fosters an understanding of programming as a collaborative endeavor, emphasizing teamwork, code presentation to review panels, and adaptation to evolving code bases.

**Key Course Components:**

- **Assignment Structure:** Each assignment undergoes rigorous unit testing and Maven-based build processes. Compliance with quality standards, including achieving 75% or higher Jacoco Coverage and zero reporting in Check Style, FindBug, and PMD, is mandatory.
  
- **Workload:** The average workload for each assignment is approximately 40 hours per week, equivalent to one month of full-time Software Development Engineer (SDE) production.

**Course Learning Outcomes:**

Upon completion of CS 5010, students will have developed the following competencies:

- Designing object-oriented solutions for small and moderately-sized problems
- Implementing object-oriented designs using Java
- Generating comprehensive documentation for developed solutions
- Designing and implementing unit tests using the JUnit testing framework
- Creating, refining, and expressing designs using graphical notation such as UML diagrams
- Exploring existing documentation to effectively describe and utilize libraries and frameworks

Through these objectives and learning outcomes, CS 5010 aims to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the field of software development.
